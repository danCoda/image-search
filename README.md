# Image Search

This is a simple React web app that uses [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) API to search for images. 

It is hosted online; try it out here on [Netlify](https://sharp-leakey-ae0f22.netlify.app/).

It uses React class components, axios (NPM module), HTML form, and is mobile responsive.

** Usage

If you want to download the code, you can run it locally with ```npm run```; pretty simple.
